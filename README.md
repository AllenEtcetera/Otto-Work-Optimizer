Otto is a UI-based automation tool that can help with workflow and daily life. Do you know how a solution to a problem on the computer, but find it too tedious to do? Otto can help; the user can have Otto perform repetitive tasks. Say they want to create a list of names, but each name has to have a special set of characters for every line; The user will be able to repeat a set of inputs a fixed number of times, or repeat a section of text a fixed number of times. Otto will also have a feature that sorts content in a file or systematically overwrites files. Lastly, it will come with a calculator that includes modulo and other programming-exclusive necessities, for when you have to make quick calculations. All data to be saved by the user will be saved wherever and however the user desires. As of now and for the projected future, account management is not necessary for full functionality.
For functionality, Otto will run on Python. It will work fully on Windows and Linux (Iâ€™ve tested it on both). MacOSX functionality is to be determined, but should theoretically work.
In short, Otto is a computer multi-tool for productivity that is primarily for programming, but will still be useful for any work on the computer.

# Utilities
## OttoInput
OttoInput gives the user a means to repeat a set of inputs a fixed number of times. Think of how an autoclicker digitally inputs left click constantly.
OttoInput does something similar, but you can use a set of inputs that function in a user-defined pattern. Additionally, the user can control the number of times the input pattern is repeated.

## OttoList
OttoList generates a list for the user, converting text or providing a premade list. It can also format the list in various programming languages.
Premade lists include names, countries, animals, numbers, letters, and alphanumeric characters.

## OttoMath
OttoMath is a programming calculator that uses standard Python language. There are a few buttons in case the user is unfamiliar with math in Python.

## OttoNotes
OttoNotes is a note program with the option to encrypt text.

## OttoOverwrite
OttoOverwrite is a program that overwrites or appends data, using data from a user-selected file.
Say the user wants to add a note to the bottom of all text files. OttoOverwrite has the option to append all text files to have that note without overwriting any other data.

## OttoRemind
OttoRemind reminds the user of a task to be done, at random intervals.
The user defines a task and selects the date for a deadline. As the deadline gets closer, the reminders come up more frequently.
The reminders come up at random, so it doesn't have something in the corner that the user can easily ignore.

## OttoSort
OttoSort sorts text data in a file by various different means. This includes alphabetical, by word length, and by how often the word is used.
When sorting, you can overwrite or create a new file. Sorting can also occur by line.

## OttoHour
OttoHour notifies the user of an hour passing. This is baked into the Hub and doesn't use a separate window.
